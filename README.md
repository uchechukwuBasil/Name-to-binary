# Name-to-binary

//input your name and see it in bin base



algorithm for this programme is:

1. convert each character to its decimal representation

2. convert the decimal represntation to binary represntation

3. output '0' (in computers, each character needs 1 byte = 8 bits so,when you convert it to binary representation  you need to complete the missing bits)



Enjoy!
